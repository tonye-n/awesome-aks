# awesome-aks

This is a collection of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) related Infrastructure-as-Code templates and scripts that I use for demos, testing, and blogs.

I'll create new IaC code as I go and will not be updating previous entries unless absolutely needed so things will get stale over time.

## Pre-requisites

- Bash shell
- Azure CLI
- Terraform
- kubectl
- Helm
- Azure subscription with permissions to create Azure and Azure AD resources, and assign roles
