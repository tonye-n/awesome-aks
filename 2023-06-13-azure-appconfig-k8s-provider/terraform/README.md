# Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider

This is a complete end-to-end demo of the [Azure App Configuration Kubernetes Provider](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-app-configuration/kubernetes-provider/about) which I blogged about [here](https://paulyu.dev/article/efficient-configuration-management-aks-integrating-azure-app-configuration/).

Before running the `terraform apply` command, be sure you have Azure CLI installed and logged in using `az login`.
